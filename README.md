# Sequential-POI-recommendation
Personalized sequential POIs recommendation task is important for
various applications such as travel route planning. The aim is to recommend a sequence of POIs to a given user based on historical synthetic
check-ins. In our lab, we first generate the synthetic data for a specific
region (Bonn & Hannover). Then, we conduct comprehensive basic
data analysis on the already genereated data for Atlanta and develop
a seq2seq LSTM network for personalized sequential POI recommendation. We also leverage geohash based on the user check-in locations
and use it as an input feature to our model to enhance the spatial relevance and precision of the recommendations, thereby improving the
overall user experience.
